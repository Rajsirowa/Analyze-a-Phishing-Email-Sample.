1. Suspicious or Misspelled Email Addresses

    Indicator: The sender‚Äôs email address closely resembles the official domain but contains subtle differences, such as extra characters or misspellings.

    Example: support@techsupport-ph.com instead of support@techsupport.ph.

    Action: Always verify the sender's email address by checking for any discrepancies or unusual characters.

2. Generic Greetings

    Indicator: The email uses generic salutations like "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of addressing you by your name.

    Example: "Dear Customer, your account has been compromised."

    Action: Legitimate companies typically use personalized greetings. Be cautious of emails lacking personalization.

3. Urgent or Threatening Language

    Indicator: The email creates a sense of urgency or threatens negative consequences if immediate action is not taken.

    Example: "Immediate action required: Your account will be suspended if you do not respond within 24 hours."
